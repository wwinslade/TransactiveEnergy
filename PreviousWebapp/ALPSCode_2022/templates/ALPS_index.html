						<h4>About ALPS</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="content-section-container">

						The Automated Load Planning System (ALPS) offers a solution for managing energy consumption among consumers
						and dealing with high demand for the power grid. It addresses how to flatten a demand curve, i.e. the duck 
						curve, and prevent potential blackouts, by using a website to control appliances. ALPS also demonstrates how 
						automated demand response (ADR) signals can be integrated into smart home systems to shift demand from high to 
						low stress periods, with the ultimate goal of saving time, money, and resources for both power providers and 
						consumers.
						<br>
						<br>
						The goals that this project needs to achieve for the customer is to be able to manage energy consumption efficiently, 
						overall saving money, and flatten the demand curve for power production saving time and resources for generation companies. 
						In order to accomplish these main objectives, we will create a website with ADR in order to control appliances within a 
						certain price threshold. This will allow customers to control their appliances and save money, while also saving resources 
						for the grid to function properly. In this website it is necessary to create it to encompass the functionality of ADR, customer 
						input and customizability with home appliances, and maintain security on the website.
						<br>
						<br>
						This project is directed to become centralized around the consumer, while also benifiting heavy power suppliers with functionality 
						on the grid. With the focus on the consumer, we intend to focus primarily on saving the consumer money by managing their home 
						appliances efficiently. The future goals that this project will focus on is developing a mobile app where consumers can manage their 
						appliances outside of their home, customizable dynamic pricing where the consumer will change at what cost do they want to turn off 
						certain appliances, and security with custom profiles and login credentials.

							This figure shows the complete construction and wiring of all the devices of the ALPS model home. 
							The current transformer on the bottom right detects current flow to the fridge and feeds the reduced
							current to the IoTaWatt (WiFi Energy Monitor) on the top right. The IoTaWatt is independent from the 
							Raspberry Pi and records power draw over time; the graphs of this data can be found on the 
							<a href="{{ url_for('ALPS_powergeneration') }}" onclick="return showPowergeneration()" value= "Display"><u>Graphs</u></a> 
							tab of this website. The Raspberry Pi uses its internet connection via ethernet, the USB thermometer, and 
							its connection to the relay array via GPIO pins to control all the devices of the model house. The
							WiFi plugs (seen at the top of the house of the left) are controlled via a combination of Python, PHP, 
							and Ajax scripts that update a device database. On the other hand, the fridge requires a hard wired
							connection from the relay array to control its internal compressor for cooling.

						The diagram below shows how all the pieces of the puzzle work together to create a cohesive product to save the customer money and 
						flatten the demand curve. The automated system is based around the Python scripts which run constantly. The Python scripts handle 
						interpreting the pricing and power consumption data, communicating with the website, and telling the refridgerator and other home  
						appliances to turn on and off. The website user interface shows the user the status of each appliance and allows the user to change
						settings individually. The Raspberry Pi is responsible for taking power consumption data from the fridge through the power meter so
						it can be recorded.
